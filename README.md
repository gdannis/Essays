<br><b>Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?</b>
<BR> While supervising crisis intervention chats between volunteer counselors and LGBTQ youth nationwide I have witnessed firsthand the powerful impact of good programming and also how traumatic it can be when it doesn’t work. The software that the organization uses is made by another company and has had so many glitches that our services are sometimes unavailable. This has been frustrating, as I see how it affects our users when they are unable to access the support they rely on to keep them safe, but also enlightening as I have worked with the tech team to troubleshoot the issues.
